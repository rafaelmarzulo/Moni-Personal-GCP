# GCP Project Configuration
project_id   = "your-gcp-project-id"        # REQUIRED: Your GCP project ID
project_name = "monipersonal"                # Project name for resource naming
environment  = "dev"                         # Environment name

# Region and Zone
region = "us-central1"       # GCP region
zone   = "us-central1-a"     # GCP zone (for zonal cluster)

# Example with cost optimization for dev:
# region = "us-central1"     # Use closest region to reduce latency
# zone   = "us-central1-a"   # Single zone is cheaper for dev
